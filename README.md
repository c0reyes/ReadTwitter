# ReadTwitter

I created this script for collect data from twitter to use in my TFM.

## readstream.py

The script to connect to twitter stream, its configure only for get polygons.

## readfiles.py

Maybe its not necesary, you can read the json directily.

## bots.py

Check a list of twitter account and verify if are bots or something like that ;-)

## geolocation.py

Twitter api not offer geo location about the origin of the tweets, but you can try to get the location of the city.
